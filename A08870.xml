            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is good for men oftentimes to call to minde thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which eyther do compell them, or allure them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto the doctrine which GOD hath eſpecially deliuered vnto his church, and doth perſeuer therein: of which ſort are Myracles, Antiquity a kind of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, a myraculous preſeruation thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the ruines of Empyres, the conſtancy of confeſſors, and pledge of Gods ſpirite in the hart.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14279:4"/>
            <p>In the firſt place, are reckoned Miracles, which are wonders done beyond the courſe of nature; for although the whole courſe of of nature be both a witnes and a warning of God, yet when he preferred his doctrine, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that which goeth beyonde the ſight of reaſon; he added ſinguler deedes beyond the courſe of nature, that it might be known not to be deuiſed by man, but ſet foorth by the guider of nature, and a moſt mightie cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, being diſtinct fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the opinions of other nations: which miracles do boaſt of certaine of our owne Miracles: but there are other Miracles peculier to the church not to be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitated by any creature: as raiſing the dead, to ſtay the courſe of the ſun, the going backe of the ſun, a virgine to be with childe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuch like. Theſe God would haue vs to looke vpon, that wee mighte bee throughlie perſwaded that the doctrine is giuen by the very ruler of nature. Among the miracles, I alſo account the prophetes, forſayinges of of Empires, &amp; other affaires, which the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of no creature could certainlye forſee: for in that the euent hath been aunſwearable vnto them, we muſt confeſſe that thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayings were manifeſted by that diuine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that knoweth all thinges.</p>
            <p>In the 2. place, is antiquitie named, which albeit, that it doth not conuince as miracles <pb facs="tcp:14279:4"/>do, yet doth it alure the mindes of men: for it is likely that God ſhould from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haue laide open himſelfe, and haue been of this mind, that amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt men there ſhuld be alwaies ſome of whom he might be truelye known, and not that al mankind as wretched ſhuld from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begining be made, only for eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore, comfortable is that former age, and well is that ſpoken by Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian. Whatſoeuer is moſt auncient, is moſt true: In like maner, doth <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> confute the <hi>Ethnickes:</hi> that ſeeing the doctrine of the Church is more ancient then the opinions of the Ethnickes, the oppinions that do gain-ſay it are to be reiected, &amp; that the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> are of more antiquitie then the writinges of the heathens, the very order of times &amp; Empires do make manifeſt For no Nation hath a certain obſeruation of yeeres from the begining, as haue the Ecle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical books: the names of the heathens do alſo ſhew, that the monuments of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Church are more auncient, for that the Grecians doe retaine the names of <hi>Iapetus, Ioue, Aeolus,</hi> and many others, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whence they ſprong: but when the ſtorie of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ſhew their kindred, we muſt needes confeſſe, that it is more auncient then the monuments of the Greekes: a mightie &amp; <pb facs="tcp:14279:5"/>a famous people was that of the <hi>Imerians,</hi> whoſe poſteritie without all doubt, was the Cimbrians, but their ſtocke your Greekes know not, which the ſome of the word doth ſhew to be <hi>Gomer</hi> the ſon of <hi>Iaphet.</hi> Nowe there is a kindered among the Egiptians, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their naturall ſpeech, and in the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Mizrai,</hi> but bookes doe ſhew <hi>Nizraim</hi> to be the ſon of
<hi>Cham,</hi> the firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient among the Greekes, were the wars of the Argonians, and then of the Troianes, but the time &amp; courſe of yeers, which the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians themſelues haue obſerued, doth ſhewe that the Troiane warre was not long before <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that <hi>Hercules</hi> was almoſt of the ſame time with Sapſon: So the names &amp; hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the heathen do teſtifie, that the books of the church are the more auncient, which is very neceſſarie for the ſtudious to conſider.</p>
            <p>In the third place, wee haue ſet a kinde of doctrine, whereof there are two partes, the Law and the Goſpell, and ſeeing that the knowledg of the law is graffted in the minds of all men, reaſon in all men is inforced to confeſſe, that it is impoſſible for any nation to be the people of God, which do eſtabliſh lawes, contrary to the law of God: but this is the common madnes of all the Gentils, to call vpon a multitude of Gods, and to deuiſe <pb facs="tcp:14279:5"/>monſtrous fables of the gods, and euen in their lawes to yeeld vnto the filthy confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of luſt. Some of them alſo, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of men, whordoms and adulteries, haue bin thought a good ſeruing of God. Reaſon therfore enforceth to confeſſe, that in the church, the law is taught much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This argument alſo, the olde writers haue vſed in confuting the heathen: and howſoeuer the Goſpel be not knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reaſon, yet doth it lay open thoſe things whereof the doctrine of the heathen can ſpeake no certainty: and yet it cannot bee denied, but that the vnderſtanding of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is neceſſary; forſomuch as man is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and is made to knowe and praiſe the Lorde. From whence come ſo many doubtes in the diſagreements of the minde and hart? whence is that ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the hart, and ſuch a burning deſire to ſin, ſeeing that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> law ſhineth in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mind? Are men made to liue in euerlaſting ſin &amp; myſery? what is ſin, &amp; whence comes that vaſt heap of humane myſerye? whence are thoſe ſo manye diſſentions about God, as whether god doeth heare men, or why hee ſhuld regard them. Whether after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bodies are once dead, there ſhalbe another life; in which ſhalbe a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene good &amp; bad?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14279:6"/>
            <p>What, men are Gods temple who he doth heare and helpe. Of theſe ſo waighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what great darkneſſe is there in all the wiſedome of the heathen? Howe many fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Phyloſophers, who like the ſons of
<hi>Tytan</hi> make war with heauen: eyther imagining that there is no prouidence, or being God to ſecondary cauſes, and labour to proue that al ſins are of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Seeing therfore we muſt confeſſe, that the doctrine of the cauſes and remedies of euil is neceſſary for men; and yet the wiſdome of the heathen ſeeth it not truly, let vs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Gods voice in the church, ſeeing hee hath added great teſtimony therunto Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon acknowledgeth, that the law is no wher purely deliuered but in the church. And ſeeing it is certaine that the voice of God is there, let vs heare this doctrin of which the Heathen are inforced to confeſſe, that ther is great ignorance in their religion and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: and yet the opening of theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are neceſſarye for the knowing of God (for the which man was made) and for true comfort. Therefore that kind of doctrine in the Church, is moſt delightfull to good mindes, when the pure fountaines are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of taſted. I account not in the Church the Romane tyrants, and the Monks their cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, <pb facs="tcp:14279:6"/>who haue diſperſed throughout the world their filthy poiſon, for the doctrine of the ſonne of God, and haue transformed the doctrine of the church, into heatheniſh opinions. They pray vnto the dead men, they command men to worſhip their brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den God, which they carry about in theyr great ſolemnity: they ſel ſacrifices for the quicke and dead: they make Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſtage-like veſtures, and other deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and confirme their rouing luſts. This wicked rout, I cal not the church, but them which deliuer the ſounde doctrine of God, deliuered in the bookes of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, and in the Creeds. Many others alſo doe corrupt the ſimple truth, and the ſleights in diſputing are delightful to ſom: as in time paſt, to the Stoicks, Epicures, &amp; Academicks. But when wee commende this kind of doctrine, we do exclude al cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption and toyes in vaine diſputings.</p>
            <p>In the 4. place, we account the wonder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful preſeruation of the church, in the midſt of the ruines of Empires: which although it may be gathered vnder the firſt teſtimony that is among myracles, yet in this it differs from the former, bicauſe it is a perpetual mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the continuall preſence of God, &amp; pertains to that ſpecial rule. The worde of
<pb facs="tcp:14279:7"/>the Lord abideth for euer, and not by the helpe of man, as it is written, <hi>Not in an hoſt nor in ſtrength, but in my ſpirit,</hi> ſaith the lord God of boaſts.</p>
            <p>In the 5. place, is the conſtancy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors accounted, which confirm others 2 waies. Firſt, bicauſe it is a mannes myracle, wherin God ſtrengthens the weak againſt fear &amp; puniſhments, &amp; ſhews his preſents many waies, euen in their ſuffrings. Many ſimple men haue raiſed the dead, and done many wonders. 2. Bicauſe the high minds in ſuch as quietly bear affliction, doth ſhew the goſpel is powerfull in them, &amp; that it is the ſeed of god, as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: <hi>wherby eternal life, righteouſnes and ioy is begun in them.</hi> 6, This teſtimony of the goſpel in the faithful doth plainly conuince their minds: namely, the comfort and ioy which is kindled in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the holy ghoſt (wherof

Steukfild writeth, that God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with mens minds, without any means: from whence he proues the diuine motions are kindled, not by meditation of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doctrin, but by a faming of heauineſſe.

From whence he gathred, that we muſt not iudge after the letter, but as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit directs.

Some there are which carry about with them the books of <hi>Sibils,</hi> whence they take ſuch Oracles as beſt befit theyr affections, whom they flatter.

And againe, The Goſpel is the power of God vnto ſaluation to euery one that beleeueth: and thoſe deceiuers are not to be harkened vnto, which crye out, that inſpirations muſt elſe-where be ſought for, without thinking of the holy worde. The ſaying of the ſonne of God muſt bee helde faſt, whoe commandeth to preach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; forgiuenes of ſins in his name. To this end let our teaching be applyed: that repentance, faith prayer and newe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may increaſe in vs, by the meditation of Gods word, and let god be praiſed with true duties, according, to that ſaying: <hi>Fight thou a good fight, holding faſt faith &amp; a good conſcience.</hi> For traps may be laide by men by the aduancing of Inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as we haue often ſeene. By this meanes, as by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment the people diſcerned of ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Therfore the ſonne is ſent to reueale vnto all creatures, the ſecret and vnknown promiſe of reconciliation, and that it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard, faith might be wrought in men, and God might communicate himſelf with vs, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaieth: <hi>Faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> Wherfore theſe Idol prieſts of <hi>Cibel,</hi> which withdraw mens mindes from the written word, do reproch the ſon of God, and take away both faith,

            <p>If the writinges of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were taken away, ſo that euery hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite might lawfully brotch his counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait Oracles from his inſpirations, as from his three footed ſeate: howe great furies would enſue?

            <p>Thy purpoſe and indeuour therefore (O <hi>Peter</hi>) I do commend, that thou art an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of all the godly vnto reading. As

            <p>And whereas, by the wiſedome of your noble King, and the diligence of godly tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers in your kingdom, the ſtudies of your youth are ſo ordered, that no liberty to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill <pb facs="tcp:14279:9"/>is permitted vnto them.

Chriſt asked the Phariſies of the doctrine of Iohn the Baptiſt, whether it were from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or of men, ſignifying, that thoſe two kinds of doctrin did greatly differ one from another, the which alſo Chriſts diſputation with Nichodemus maketh plaine. Ioh. 3,</p>
            <p>The word of God is the holy Scripture of the old and new Teſtament, which is called holy (that is) ſeuered from all other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb facs="tcp:14279:10"/>written by the holy Ghoſt &amp; brought from heauen.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt deuideth the olde Teſtament into 3. partes in the laſt of Luke, where hee ſaith that all thinges muſt be fulfilled what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer are written of the ſonne of man.</p>

            <p n="2">2 The truth of the ſcripture is proued by the wordes of Chriſt. Iohn. 8, Thy worde is truth. Ioh. 2, The old and new Teſtament is true &amp; the true light now ſhineth. Num 23, God is not as man that he ſhould lie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The profit of the ſcripture is ſhewed by Paule Rom 15, Whatſoeuer things are writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten they are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our learning, that tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row patience &amp; comfort of the ſcripture we might haue hope, 2 Tim. 3, all ſcripture in ſpired of God is profitable to teach, &amp;c.</p>

For thoſe things which are contained in this hiſtorye, happened in the Perſian Monarchy, after the returne of the Iewes from Babylon, but before the reſtoring of the people.</p>
                  <p>And God to preſerue his people, among whom Chriſt ſhould be borne, he did heere myraculouſly put away a danger, which was intended againſt all the Iewes, which as yet remained in Perſia, by this example to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them that returned home, and incorage them confidently &amp; cheerfully to go forward in reſtoring that common-weale wherein Chriſt was to preach the Goſper, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his gouernment.</p>

                  <p>Otherwiſe, there are 16, chap, as in the booke of Iudith, which are diuided, as it were in maner of a Comedy,</p>
                  <p>The firſt act might be vnto the 4. chapt, wherin Queen Vaſthi diſobeying her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is put away, and Heſtera moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull virgin, is choſen Queene. But by the aduancement of Haman, and his deceit, the Iewes doe mourne, bicauſe that all of them were in danger of their liues, by the letters that the kinge ſent out againſte them. So may wee ſee by this example of Vaſthi and Heſter, howe God doeth put downe the mighty from theyr ſeate, and exalteth the humble: and in Haman, howe God for a time doth ſuffer tyrants to flouriſh and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize, that their fal and puniſhment may be the greater in the end.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond acte, is from the 4. chap, to the 9, in which followeth a comfort by this Qu. Heſter, that beeing perſwaded by Mardocheus his many prayers, taketh vpon her the defence of the Iewes, and bringeth Mardocheus into the kinges fauour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <pb facs="tcp:14279:34"/>at length Hamans deceit beeing made knowne to the king, hee is hanged, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther letters contrarie to the former, are ſent foorth, wherby the people of the Iewes are deliuered from danger of death, and their mourning is turned into ioy, that it might be verified of Haman, which the Pſalm ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: He fell into the pit which hee made but of the Iewes: the net is broken and we are deliuered.</p>

                  <p>THe booke of Iob is named of Iob, of whom is ſaide in the
14. of Ezech. If theſe three were in the middeſt of them, Noce, Daniell and Iob, they in their owne righteouſnes ſhould deliuer their own ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes. But who wrote this booke? Moſes (as ſome thinketh) or ſome other, it is vncertaine. Neither ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth much to knowe it, ſeeing it is out of queſtion, that this booke contayneth the words of the holy ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of the booke handleth this queſtion. Whither the righteons are afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, or not? Iob prooues by many firme arguments, that God vſeth to ſend manye afflictions to innocent and godlye men, onelye for his owne glorie: as Chriſt ſpeaketh af a man borne blinde, Iohn. 9.</p>
                  <p>But the friends of Iob impugn this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and they contend with him in many <pb facs="tcp:14279:35"/>probable arguments, that the godly are not afflicted of God, but if they bee afflicted, then it is for their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>This whole booke is ſpent betwixt Iob and his 4. friends; at length God himſelfe diſſolues the controuerſie.</p>

                     <p>In the firſt three chapt, is contained: hiſtory of the diuers afflictions of Iob, and the temptations of Sathan, that firſt aſſailed Iobs children and his poſſeſsions, but when he ſuffered all that moſt patiently, at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth he ſet vpon his owne perſon, whereby hee was made ſo vnpatient thorowe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of griefe, that he did not onely horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly curſſe the day of his natiuity, but alſo praiſe death before this life: where it is to be obſerued, how diligently ſathan perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in temptation, vntil he make man hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly to ſinne againſt God.</p>
                     <p>From the 4 chap, vnto the 8, is deſcribed the firſte diſputation betwixt Iob and his friende Eliphaz the Themanite: the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Eliphaz propounded againſte Iob; to wit, God puniſheth men onely for their ſinnes: Iob anſwered, that he tooke it not to be ſo: and he complaineth of the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſomneſſe <pb facs="tcp:14279:35"/>of his friendes, that they didde more terrifie him, then comfort him.</p>
                     <p>From the 8, chap, to the 11, is written the ſecond Shuhite diſputation, betwixte Iob and his ſecond friende Bildad, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame argument: that God punni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth Iob for his ſinnes, the which Iob a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine denyeth to bee ſo, with a complaint that he did not know the cauſe of his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>From the 11, vnto the 15, followes the 3. diſputation concerning the ſame argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, betwixt Iob &amp; his third friend Zophar, the Naamathite, to whom Iob did propounde this queſtion. Wherfore are good men ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times in diſtreſſe? 5. and afterwards he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldeth the queſtion or argument, and at length bewails all mens myſerie on earth.</p>
                     <p>From the 15, vnto the 22, againe Iobs three friendes begin in order to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Firſt Eliphaz accuſeth Iob to be a ſinner, the which Iob denieth not: and then reproues Eliphaz and his fellowes, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that they were badde comforters. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Bildad, as he had before, ſaith; that God vſeth to puniſh the wicked for theyr ſinnes with many plagues; &amp; he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, Iob to be wicked, becauſe he is much pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <pb facs="tcp:14279:36"/>of God. Iob anſwereth, that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude &amp; ſtrength was in the graue. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Zophar alledgeth that it goeth wel with wicked menne, but not long: and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to prooue that Iob is ſuch a one. Iob ſhewes the contrary to be true in euery part that is to wit; that it goeth long well with the wicked in this life, but that hee is not wicked.</p>
                     <p>From the 22, vnto the 32, Iobs 2 friends Eliphas and Bildad, did yet more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet vpon him with the ſame opinion, repli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng herewith according to mans reaſon as they did before, but in vaine was it. Iob ſtandeth with a ſetled minde, although hee lay in great myſery. Somtimes he teacheth them, and ſometimes hee addes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes: ſometimes he purgeth himſelfe before his friendes, that he was of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable life.</p>
                     <p>From the 32, to the end, God himſelfe at length doth preach before Iob, rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the works of his power, minding to teach him, that he was vniuſtly accuſed of him. Vpon the which ſermon in the laſte chap, Iob repenteth, and is reſtored to his perfection, for an example to vs all of true repentance.</p>

                     <p>In the third we haue a famous ezample of repentaunce in the Niniuites, to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of all ſinners; where theſe thinges are ſeuerely to be obſerued, &amp; by no means to be <g ref="char:abpre">p̄</g>termitted. 1 That God is the god of the gentiles, 2 That God is of power, good and iuſt, 3 what repentance is, 4 That true faſting ſerueth to repentance.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth, the carnall carefulneſſe of
<hi>Ionas</hi> is deſcribed, howe hee would haue him reſpected with the damage and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance <pb facs="tcp:14279:58"/>of his neighbors: ſuch is the great imperfection and fleſhly feare in mankind, yea euen of the ſaints: but in God there is mercy and clemency towardes all ſinners truely repenting.

Afterward, returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Galily, firſt of all he ſatisfied 5000. men with fiue loues and two fiſhes.</p>
                        <p>And afterwardes, he diſputed very long with the Iewes concerning the ſpirituall bread, which is the word of God.

                        <p>The third he beginneth in the 7. chapt. and continueth vnto the 12. chapter. In which chiefly hee taught in the Temple of Ieruſalem, not without contradiction and perill. Firſt, concerning the authority of
<pb facs="tcp:14279:76"/>his doctrine. Secondlye, concerning the Sabbaoth. Thirdly, concerning his owne perſon. Fourthlye, concerning his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe.

Straight way hee taught the people: and vnto the end of the eight chapter, he diſputed ſharply againſte the Iewes. By and by, hee gaue ſight to one that was borne blinde: whence no ſmall contention did ariſe betwixt the Phariſies and him that was borne blinde, vnto the end of the ninth chap. Here hee ſhewes himſelfe to be the true paſtour, wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he fals into diſputation with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes vnto the end of the tenth chapter.

                        <p>Vnto the ende of the 12. chapt. in the next places: he declares, what was doone in the Inne at Ieruſalem, in the holy ſupper of Chriſt: to wit, Howe Chriſt, after the waſhing of their feet, after the diſturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his minde for Iudas. And furthermore, after hee had foreſhewed the trecherye of Iudas, and the deniall of Peter vnto th' end of the chapt. Firſt of all hee makes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſermon, through three whole chap. Whoſe propoſicion is this. Let not your hearts be troubled. The arguments wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are three. Firſt, yee ſhall propheſie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. 2 In the meane time, the Holy ghoſt ſhal comfort you. 3 My father ſhall heare you. Then he addes a moſt effectual praier, to his holy and iuſt father. Firſt, for his owne glorification, 2 for the defence of <pb facs="tcp:14279:77"/>his diſciples. 3 For all the beleeuers in the true doctrine, that they ſhould be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and preſerued in the vnity of ſpirite. To this the Euangeliſt deſcribeth the paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt. In the 18. &amp; 19. chap. Firſt, how for the ſaluation of mankind, he was betrayed of his owne diſciple Iudas. 2 He was accuſed of the Iewes. 3 He was fixed to the Croſſe by the Gentiles.</p>
                        <p>In the two laſt chapters the Euangeliſt makes vp the ſtory, with the reſurrection of Chriſt, and ſuch thinges as happened afterwards. In one chapter hee deſcribes the appariſions of Chriſt, beeing made in Iudea, before his diſciples and others.</p>
                        <p>Whence at length as is teſtified in the other Euangeliſt, and in the other his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearinges to his diſciples in Galily.

                     <p>From the 9. chap. vnto the 12. he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the place of predeſtination, repeating the queſtion that was put in the beginning of the thirde chapter: that is to wit: what if certaine of them haue not beleeued; ſhall their vnbeleefe make the faith of GOD of none effect? God forbid, whence as hauing occaſion he firſt of all diſputes of election, that we may know to whom this grace do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth appertaine, and that alſo in the 9. cha. And after that in the 10. chap. he defines and expoundes the righteouſneſſe of fayth. Laſt of all, he teacheth that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to take offence at the name of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they are alwaies deceiued, that letting paſſe iuſtification by faith: ſeeke to begin their ſaluation from predeſtination.</p>
                     <p>From the 12. chap. vnto the end of the <pb facs="tcp:14279:81"/>Epiſtle, he ſets downe certaine admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning good works.

Laſt of all, towards inferiors; that is to ſay, the weake, chap, 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>The laſt chapter containes ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or vowes and Euangelical ſermons. And ſalutation is not to be thought the leaſt duty of humanity.</p>

                        <p>In the fourth chapter, there are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warninges, concerning vertues in euery commandement of the Tables, as in one knot or heape bound together.</p>
